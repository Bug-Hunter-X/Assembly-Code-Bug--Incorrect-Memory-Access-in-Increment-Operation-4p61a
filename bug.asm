```assembly
mov eax, [ebx+4]
add eax, 1
mov [ebx], eax
```
This code attempts to increment a value stored at memory location [ebx]. However, it contains a potential bug. It reads the value at [ebx+4] instead of [ebx], and adds 1 before writing it back. If the memory location [ebx] has some data, it might cause a memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
